# 🌾 Crop Recommendation System

An intelligent crop recommendation web app that utilizes machine learning to suggest the most suitable crops based on soil and climate conditions. This project enables users to input parameters like nitrogen, phosphorus, temperature, humidity, and rainfall and receive accurate crop suggestions using trained ML models.

## 🔍 Overview

This system is built using:
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (responsive design with media queries)
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning Models:** Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors
- **Dataset:** [Crop Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset)

Users can:
- Input soil and weather parameters
- Choose an ML model (RF, DT, KNN)
- Get top 3 recommended crops with prediction probabilities
- View a summary of input parameters
